  initial allocation

* flow-capture, flow-receive -m option.  Mask ip addresses (srcaddr,dstaddr)
  in version 1,5,6,7 with privacy mask.  Defaults to 255.255.255.255.
  Does not alter multicast S,G's.

* flow-capture, flow-send, flow-receive, flow-fanout call bigsockbuf() to
  allocate large socket buffers instead of setsockopt() directly.

* bigsockbuf() implementation.  Instead of using a hard coded value
  when attempting to extend the socket buffer size which can vary
  among systems, guess, then decrement by 512 bytes on failure until
  success.  Noted by jason@intercom.com

* flow-fanout handle signals, log PDU version forwarding.

* flow-fanout checks sequence numbers, version, and verifies integrity
  of received packets before forwarding

* flow-capture, flow-fanout utilize fterr_setexit() to ensure removal of
  pidfile.

* fterr_setxit() implementation

* flow-gen - do not create bogus flows, use more reasonable initialization.
  Noted by Robert Hough <rch@solveinteractive.com>

* flow-stat - ignore bogus 0 packet flows instead of divide by 0
  Noted by Robert Hough <rch@solveinteractive.com>

* working docs/Makefile.am

* 4-24-2001 flow-tools-0.53 released

* Solaris portability buglets

* flow-fanout,flow-receive,flow-capture support joining a multicast group
  for receiving flows localip/remoteip/port is replaced by s/g/port

* flow-send,flow-fanout set the ttl if the destination address is multicast
  localip/remoteip/port -> localip/remoteip/port/ttl.  TTL defaults to 0.

* flow-fanout maintaines pidfile

* flow-fanout will honor SIGQUIT

* flow-capture will unlink pid file on exit

* flow-capture log SIGQUIT and SIGHUP

* flow-capture will honor SIGQUIT before processing a file

* flow-fanout daemonizes by default

* flow-fanout,flow-capture,flow-send,flow-receive all use common format
  to describe peer - localip/remoteip/port

* flow-send,flow-fanout can set local IP address when sending

* flow-receive,flow-capture,flow-fanout can bind to a specific local IP

* added directory support to flow-cat

* added directory support to flow-capture and flow-expire

* flow-cat all command line options not processed due to unbalanced "

* flow-capture - filenames generated have +- GMT offset
  (example from Dave Plonka <plonka@doit.wisc.edu>)

* ftio_set_ver(): use new ver struct for updating ftio->fth.fields, not old
  (broken v8 files)

* fttlv_enc_uint8(): 1 byte encoding, not 2
  (broken v8 files)

* 4-8-2001 flow-tools 0.52 released

* prepend FT_ to QUEUE* functions to prevent conflicting with BSDI's
  sys/queue.h

* flow-stat.c stat0() also report in realtime.

* fterr.c portablilty

* 3-14-2001 flow-tools 0.51 released

* Fixed byte ordering problem with flow-fanout

* Added ToS based format to flow-stat

* compsci@cs.fiu.edu time fields byte order problem on BIG_ENDIAN

* Added Miguel A.L. Paraz <map@internet.org.ph> flow-split to contrib

* flow-capture header size rewrite fix

* fixed longword alignment problem in ftio_write_header()

* generalized error/warning/info with fterr_*()

* 3-11-2001 flow-tools 0.50 released

* added mmap() support for reading flows.  flow-cat can enable it.

* initial implementation of ifName:ifIndex and alias mappings.  flow-receive
  and flow-capture will add the mappings if they exist.

* added SECURITY document

* flow-cat handles ^C

* new tool, flow-split.  Split a flow stream based on # of flows or time

* fixed sequence # calculation when encoding

* stream version 3 -- variable length header, exporter ip in flows.
  note, version 2 not supported.

* fixed memory dealloc / potential core dump on exit bug in flow-dscan.c

* new utility flow-header to just dump the header of a file/stream

* flow-capture and flow-receive update lost flows and sequence resets in
  header

* flow-receive rewrites header on close and updates fields properly

* flow-capture and flow-receive update new exporter_ip field in header

* 2-21-2001 flow-tools 0.411 released

* Andrey Zolotnicky" <andrey@kost.kz> detach in flow-capture main() shadows
  global

* Andrey Zolotnicky" <andrey@kost.kz> ftpdu_check_seq() fix

* 2-20-2001 flow-tools 0.41 released

* html and man docs included in make dist

* ftpdu_check_seq() implementation.  Check and report errors with
  received sequence numbers

* include everything needed for lex/yacc to build acl* including yyerror()
  for linux

* use autoconf macros to include string.h / strings.h

* All files use config.h

* inspect return val of ftio_set_version() to bomb out earlier

* ftio_init(), and ftio_set_version properly return error

* flow-gen uses same -V format as flow-receive and flow-capture

* flow-receive and flow-capture have -I <ip address of exports> and 
  -V <PDU version expecting> options.  -I required for flow-capture

* resurrected flow-export hack to dump flows in pcap format

* ftset_init() - code simplify/cleanup

* AS 0 substitition option in flow-receive and flow-capture

* CFLAGS = -g -ansi -Wall

* ftio_set_nflows() uses u_int32 not u_int64

* flow-capture not properly updating nflows in header

* ftpdu_verify() implemented

* Miguel A.L. Paraz" <map@internet.org.ph - potential unitialized return
  value in ftio_close()

* Added perl/ftprint - example of using flow-tools with perl

* Fixed autoconfig problem where everything was linked with lex/yacc libs

* Andrey Zolotnicky" <andrey@kost.kz> - linux modifies timeval after select()
  - fixed flow-capture.c and flow-fanout.c

* 2-11-2001 flow-tools 0.40 released

* FT_IO_MAXDECODE and FT_IO_MAXENCODE bumped up to 4K
